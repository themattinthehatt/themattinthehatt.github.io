					<h2>Research Interests</h2>
					<p>As we move through the world around us our senses collect huge amounts of information about
					the state of our surroundings. It is the brain's job to process this information quickly and accurately
					in order to make decisions, implement coordinated motor responses, and predict future events. How does 
					the brain do this? I am	interested in studying sensory processing systems in order to better understand the 
					fundamental computations that	neurons perform during the processing of external stimuli. I am also 
					interested in how internal states such as motivation and attention influence these computations.</p>
					<p>More broadly, I am interested in how the fundamental principles underlying these computational strategies
					employed by the brain can be translated into artificial information processing systems. Over the last decade
					it has become clear that powerful new machine learning approaches like deep neural networks have a superficial
					but strong connection to biological information processing systems, like the visual system. Further developing
					these parallels will inevitably result in significant scientific and technological advances in the years to come.

					<h2>Discovering Latent Sources of Variability in Neuronal Populations</h2>
					<p>The study of sensory cortical neurons has traditionally been carried out by recording from one or a few neurons.
					Recent advances in 2-photon microscopy now allow us to simultaneously record hundreds or even thousands of neurons
					in superficial layers of cortex. Since stimulus representation and processing is manifested in spatiotemporal
					patterns of activity in-vivo, these new experimental approaches have the power to revolutionize our understanding
					of cortical function.</p>
					<p>Currently, however, there are no standard techniques for analyzing the vast amounts of data 
					these experiments generate.	The aim of this project is to develop a unified statistical framework that combines 
					stimulus processing	models and latent variable models of neural activity. I am interested in using this model to 
					address questions	about the nature of the interactions between stimulus processing and ongoing cortical network 
					dynamics in large	populations of sensory neurons.</p>
